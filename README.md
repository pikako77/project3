<h1>US Energy Consumption Analysis</h1>


<h2>Project Goal and Purpose:</h2
</h4>This project built on the previous Energy Consumption project to continuing on with data analysis of the different types of energy sources in the United States. We took our analysis further and apply predictive analysis using Machine Learning. 
In addition we used Tablaeu for more in depth visualization and trend analysis.

We created 3 Machine Learning models using Deep Learning to provide predictive analysis of Gas and Coal consumption using the key parameters of Temperature effect.
The Tablaeu visualization focused on showing the correlation between the Price of the different energy consumption sources in the residential, industrial and commercial sectors. Visualizations of the price variation for energy consumption across the various US States was created. 

Drilling down further to focus on the state of Texas we created visualizations of the effect of average temperature and population growth on Gas and Coal Consumption

<h3>Questions:
  <ul>
  <li>Gas Consumption prediction as a function of Temperature or Coal</li>  
  <li>How does population afffect energy consumption? </li>
  <li>Energy Consumption and Average Price by Sector and State in US</li>
  <li>The Effect of Temperature on Gas Consumption</li>
     <li></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
<br>
Average electricity price by sector across US:
<br>
We compared energy price in each sector in every state utilizing July 2018 and July 2019 data. 

Observation: 
1. Hawaii has the highest energy cost in all sectors compare to any other states. For example, in residential sector, it costs 32.44 cents per kw vs. only 11.51 cents per kw in Texas 
2. Energy costs are distributed evenly acorss sectors in Hawaii. In other words, there's not a significant variance in energy cost among residential, commerical or industrial sector. 
This is because Hawaii has very limited choice of energy sources. Every energey consumer needs to pay a hefty price to use energy.
3. Texas is a very business friendly state when it comes to energy price. For example, it costs only 5.81 cents per kw in Texas vs. 15.23 cents per kw in California for industrial sector customers
